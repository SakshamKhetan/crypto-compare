# crypto-compare

In this paper, we aim to find the various relationships that
exist between several cryptocurrencies.

By considering data of a pre-specified period, we aim to show the hidden pattern
that exists between currencies where a rise/fall in one
currency is accompanied by a similar variation in some other
currency. 

We will be using Linear Regression to ultimately
train and test our model.
